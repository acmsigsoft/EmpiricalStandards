# Action Research 
<standard name="Action Research">

<description name = "Action Research Description">

*Empirical research that investigates how an intervention, like the
introduction of a method or tool, affects a real-life context*

</description>

## Application 

This standard applies to empirical research that meets the following
conditions.

-   investigates a primarily social phenomenon within its real-life,
    organizational context
-   intervenes in the real-life context (otherwise see the **Case Study
    Standard**)
-   the change and its observation are an integral part of addressing
    the research question and contribute to research

If the intervention primarily alters social phenomena (e.g. the
organization's processes, culture, way of working or group dynamics),
use this standard. If the intervention is a new technology or technique
(e.g. a testing tool, a coding standard, a modeling grammar), especially
if it lacks a social dimension, consider the **Engineering Research
Standard**. If the research involves creating a technology and an
organizational intervention with a social dimension, consider both
standards.

</checklist>
     
## General Quality Criteria 

Example criteria include reflexivity, credibility, resonance, usefulness
and transferability (see **Glossary**). Positivist quality criteria such
as internal validity, construct validity, generalizability and
reliability typically do not apply.

## Examples of Acceptable Deviations 

-   In a study of deviations from organizational standards, detailed
    description of circumstances and direct quotations are omitted to
    protect participants.
-   The article reports a negative outcome of an intervention and e.g.
    investigates why a certain method was not applicable.

## Antipatterns 

-   Forcing interventions that are not acceptable to participants or the
    host organization.
-   Losing professional distance and impartiality; getting too involved
    with the community under study.
-   Over-selling a tool or method without regard for participants'
    problems, practices or values.
-   Avoiding systematic evaluation; downplaying problems; simply
    reporting participants views of the intervention.

## Invalid Criticisms 

-   The findings and insights are not valid because the research
    intervened in the context. Though reflexivity is crucial, the whole
    point of action research is to introduce a change and observe how
    participants react.
-   This is merely consultancy or an experience report. Systematic
    observation and reflection should not be dismissed as consultancy or
    experience reports. Inversely, consultancy or experiences should not
    be falsely presented as action research.
-   Lack of quantitative data; causal analysis; objectivity, internal
    validity, reliability, or generalizability.
-   Sample not representative; lack of generalizability; generalizing
    from one organization.
-   Lack of replicability or reproducibility; not releasing transcripts.
-   Lack of control group or experimental protocols. An action research
    study is not an experiment.
