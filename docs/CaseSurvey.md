# Case Survey (AKA Case Meta-Analysis)
<standard name="Case Survey">



*<desc>A study that aims to generalize results about a complex phenomenon by systematically converting qualitative descriptions available in published case studies into quantitative data and analyzing the converted data</desc>*



## Application

This standard applies to studies in which:
-	a sample of previously published case studies is obtained; 
-	the qualitative case descriptions are converted systematically into quantitative data; and
-	the converted quantitative data is analyzed to reach generalizable results.

This standard does not apply to studies collecting primary data from a large number of instances of a phenomenon; for instance, using interviews (consider the **Qualitative Survey Standard**) or questionnaires (consider the **Questionnaire Survey Standard**). For individual case studies use the **Case Study Standard**. For reviews of other kinds of studies (e.g., experiments) consider the **Systematic Review Standard**. This standard also does not apply to qualitative synthesis (e.g. meta-ethnography, narrative synthesis). 

## Specific Attributes

### Essential Attributes
<checklist name="Essential">

<intro>


<method>

- [ ]   presents step-by-step, systematic, replicable description of the search process for published case studies (not necessarily in peer-reviewed venues)
- [ ]   defines clear inclusion and exclusion criteria for cases<sup>[1](#myfootnote1)</sup>
- [ ]   describes the sampling strategy (see the [Sampling Supplement](https://github.com/acmsigsoft/EmpiricalStandards/blob/master/Supplements/Sampling.md))
- [ ]   mitigates sampling bias and publication bias, using some (not all) of:   
(i) manual and keyword automated searches;   
(ii) backward and forward snowballing searches;   
(iii) checking profiles of prolific authors in the area;   
(iv) searching both formal databases (e.g. ACM Digital Library) and indexes (e.g. Google Scholar);   
(v) searching for relevant dissertations;  
(vi) searching pre-print servers (e.g. arXiv);   
(vii) soliciting unpublished manuscripts through appropriate listservs or social media;   
(viii) contacting known authors in the area.   
- [ ]   defines a coding scheme to convert qualitative case descriptions into quantitative variables<sup>[2](#myfootnote2)</sup>
- [ ]   EITHER: describes the coding scheme in detail;   
OR: provides the coding scheme in supplementary materials
- [ ]   clearly explains how missingness in the dataset was managed

<results>

- [ ]   draws conclusions based on the quantitative variables derived

<discussion>

- [ ]   acknowledges generalizability threats; discusses how case studies reviewed may differ from target population

<other>  
  
</checklist>

### Desirable Attributes
<checklist name="Desirable">

- [ ]   provides supplementary materials such as  protocol, search terms, search results, selection process results, coding scheme, examples of coding, decision rules, complete dataset, analysis scripts, descriptions of edge cases<sup>[3](#myfootnote3)</sup>
- [ ]   explains and justifies the design of the coding scheme 
- [ ]   uses 2+ independent analysts; analyzes inter-rater reliability (see the [IRR/IRA Supplement](https://github.com/acmsigsoft/EmpiricalStandards/blob/master/Supplements/InterRaterReliabilityAndAgreement.md)); explains how discrepancies among coders were resolved<sup>[4](#myfootnote4)</sup>
- [ ]   describes contacting authors of primary studies for more information, to check coding accuracy, or resolve coding disagreements
- [ ]   assesses quality of primary studies using an a priori scheme (e.g. the **Case Survey Standard**); explains how quality was assessed; models study quality as a moderating variable  
- [ ]   consolidates results using tables, diagrams, or charts; includes PRISMA flow diagram (cf. Moher et al. 2009)
- [ ]   integrates results into prior theory or research; identifies gaps, biases, or future directions
- [ ]   presents results as practical, evidence-based guidelines for practitioners, researchers, or educators
- [ ]   clearly distinguishes evidence-based results from interpretations and speculation<sup>[5](#myfootnote5)</sup>
</checklist>

### Extraordinary Attributes
<checklist name="Extraordinary">

- [ ]   uses theory to select and sample cases
- [ ]   two or more researchers independently undertake the preliminary search process before finalizing the search scope and search keywords
- [ ]   adds data from other sources to the selected cases
- [ ]   employs authors of primary studies to conduct the coding or ensure interpretations are correct
- [ ]   analyzes if/how studies’ characteristics (e.g., research design, publication venue or date) influence the coding
</checklist>

## General Quality Criteria

Reliability, internal validity, external validity, construct validity, conclusion validity

## Antipatterns

-	including primary studies that are not case studies (e.g., questionnaires or a small amounts of data) 
-	include all cases without a critical evaluation of the data available  
-	analyze data from cases using qualitative techniques  
-	describing each case in isolation rather than synthesizing findings. 
-	relying on publication venue as a proxy for quality
-	conflating correlation with causation in findings 

## Invalid Criticisms

-	the studies were not published in peer-reviewed venues
-	the original studies do not employ a common research design
-	the cases are not a random sample of the phenomenon
