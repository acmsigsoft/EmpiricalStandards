# Methodological Guidelines and Meta-Science

<standard name="Meta Science">

*<desc>A paper that analyses an issue of research methodology or makes recommendations for conducting research</desc>*

## Application

This standard applies to papers that provide analysis of one or more methodological issues, or advice concerning some aspect of research.

- may or may not include primary or secondary empirical data or analysis.
- may consider philosophical or practical issues
- may simultaneously be a methodology paper and an empirical study, to which another standard also applies; for example, if a paper reports a case study and then gives advice about a methodological issue illuminated by the case study, consider both this standard and the **Case Study Standard**.

## Specific Attributes

### Essential Attributes
<checklist name="Essential">

<results>
  
- [ ] presents information that is useful for other researchers
- [ ] makes recommendations for future research  
- [ ] presents clear, valid arguments supporting recommendations
  
<other>  
 

</checklist>
  
### Desirable Attributes
<checklist name="Desirable">

- [ ] synthesizes related work from reference disciplines
- [ ] provides insight specifically for software engineering; goes beyond summarizing methodological guidance from existing works or reference disciplines;
- [ ] results integrated back into prior theory or research
- [ ] develops helpful artifacts (e.g. checklists, templates, tests, tools, sets of criteria)
  </checklist>
  
### Extraordinary Attributes
<checklist name="Extraordinary">

- [ ] includes an empirical study (e.g. a systematic literature review) that motivates the analysis of guidance
- [ ] quantitative simulation illustrating methodological issues
  </checklist>
  
## General Criteria

- **comprehensiveness** of analysis or guidance provided
- **usefulness** to the research community
- quality of **argumentation** supporting analysis of guidance
- degree of **integration** with previous work, both in software engineering and in reference disciplines

## Antipatterns

- overreaching; informal logical fallacies (e.g. straw man argument, appeal to popularity, shifting the burden of proof)<sup><a class="footnote footnote_ref">1</a></sup> 
- discussing an issue without clear conclusions; failing to provide clear guidelines
- attacking individual studies or researchers; hypothetical examples should be used to avoid engendering animosity

## Invalid Criticisms

- Guidelines are not based on empirical evidence. Empirically testing meta-scientific propositions is typically impractical or impossible. Reviewers should evaluate the face validity, comprehensiveness and usefulness of the guidelines. It is not appropriate to reject methodological guidelines over lack of empirical support.

## Notes

Because metascientific claims often cannot be justified empirically:

- reviewers of methodology papers must themselves be experts in the methodology, so that they can evaluate the reasonableness of the guidelines
- reviewers should be more pedantic in critiquing the discussion and guidelines than for an empirical paper
