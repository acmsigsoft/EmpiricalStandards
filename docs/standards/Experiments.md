# Experiments (with Human Participants) 
<standard name="Experiments (with Human Participants)">

*<desc>A study in which an intervention is deliberately introduced to observe its effects on some aspects of reality under controlled conditions</desc>*


## Application 

This standard applies to controlled experiments and quasi-experiments
that meet all of the following conditions:

-   manipulates one or more independent variables
-   controls many extraneous variables
-   applies each treatment independently to several experimental units
-   involves human participants

In true experiments, experimental units are randomly allocated across
treatments; quasi-experiments lack random assignment. Experiments
include between-subjects, within-subjects and repeated measures designs.
For experiments without human participants, see the **Exploratory Data
Science Standard** or the **Engineering Research Standard**.

## Specific Attributes 

### Essential Attributes
<checklist name="Essential">

<intro>


<method>
    
- [ ]	states formal hypotheses
- [ ]	uses two-sided hypotheses OR justifies use of one-sided hypotheses based on face validity or previous work
- [ ]	describes the dependent variable(s) and justifies how they are measured (including units, instruments)
- [ ]	describes the independent variable(s) and how they are manipulated or measured
- [ ]	describes extraneous variables and how they are controlled: physically, statistically, or not at all    
- [ ]	justifies sample size (e.g. using power analysis) 
- [ ]	describes how characteristics of the phenomenon under investigation relate to experimental constructs
- [ ]	describes the research design and protocol including treatments, materials, tasks, design (e.g. 2x2 factorial), participant allocation, period and sequences (for crossover designs), and logistics
- [ ]	EITHER: uses random assignment and explains logistics (e.g. how random numbers were generated)   
    OR: provides compelling justification for not using random assignment and explains how unequal groups threat to validity is mitigated (e.g. using pre-test/post-test and matched subjects design)
- [ ]	describes experimental objects (e.g. real or toy system) and their characteristics (e.g. size, type)
- [ ]	justifies selection of experimental objects; acknowledges object-treatment confounds, if any<sup><a class="footnote footnote-ref">1</a></sup>
- [ ]	design and protocol appropriate (not optimal) for stated research questions and hypotheses 

<results>

- [ ]	describes participants (e.g. age, gender, education, relevant experience or preferences)
- [ ]	reports distribution-appropriate descriptive and inferential statistics; justifies tests used
- [ ]	reports effects sizes with confidence intervals (if using frequentist approach)

<discussion>

- [ ]	discusses construct, conclusion, internal, and external validity
- [ ]	discusses alternative interpretations of results

<other>    

</checklist>
     
### Desirable Attributes
<checklist name="Desirable">

- [ ]	provides supplementary material such as complete, algorithmic research protocol; task materials; raw, de-identified dataset; analysis scripts
- [ ]	justifies hypotheses and Bayesian priors (if applicable) based on previous studies and theory
- [ ]	discusses alternative experimental designs and why they were not used (e.g. validity trade-offs)
- [ ]	includes visualizations of data distributions
- [ ]	cites statistics research to support any nuanced issues or unusual approaches
- [ ]	explains deviations between design and execution, and their implications<sup><a class="footnote footnote-ref">2</a></sup>
- [ ]	named experiment design (e.g. simple 2-group, 2x2 factorial, randomized block)
- [ ]	analyzes construct validity of dependent variable
- [ ]	reports manipulation checks
- [ ]	pre-registration of hypotheses and design (where venue allows)
- [ ]	clearly distinguishes evidence-based results from interpretations and speculation<sup><a class="footnote footnote-ref">3</a></sup>
</checklist>
     
### Extraordinary Attributes
<checklist name="Extraordinary">

- [ ]	reports multiple experiments or replications in different cultures or regions
- [ ]	uses multiple methods of data collection; data triangulation
- [ ]	longitudinal data collection with appropriate time-series analysis (see the [Longitudinal Studies Standard](https://github.com/acmsigsoft/EmpiricalStandards/blob/master/docs/standards/Longitudinal.md))
</checklist>

## Examples of Acceptable Deviations
 - Sample size is not justified by power analysis a priori because the study is conducted in a classroom in which the number of available participants is fixed. 


## General Quality Criteria 

Conclusion validity, construct validity, internal validity, reliability,
objectivity, reproducibility

## Antipatterns 

-   using bad proxies for dependent variables (e.g. task completion time
    as a proxy for task complexity)
-   quasi-experiments without a good reason<sup><a class="footnote footnote-ref">4</a></sup>
-   treatments or response variables are poorly described
-   inappropriate design for the conditions under which the experiment
    took place
-   data analysis technique used does not correspond to the design
    chosen or data characteristics (e.g. using an independent samples
    t-test on paired data)
-   validity threats are simply listed without linking them to results

## Invalid criticisms

-   participants are students---appropriateness of participant
    characteristics should be judged based on the context, desired level
    of control, trade-off choices between internal and external
    validity, and the specifics of the technology (i.e. method,
    technique, tool, process, etc.) under evaluation; the choice must be
    explained in the paper
-   low external validity
-   the experiment is a replication
-   the reviewer would have investigated the topic in any other way than
    an experiment
-   not enough participants (unless supported by power analysis)
