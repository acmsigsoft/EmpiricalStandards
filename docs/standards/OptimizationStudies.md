# Optimization Studies in SE (including Search-Based Software Engineering)
<standard name="Optimization Studies">



*<desc>Research studies that focus on the formulation of software engineering problems as search problems, and apply optimization techniques to solve such problems</desc>*<sup><a class="footnote footnote_ref">1</a></sup>.  



## Application

This standard applies to empirical studies that meet the following criteria:

- Formulates a software engineering task<sup><a class="footnote footnote_ref">2</a></sup> as an optimization problem, with one or more specified fitness functions<sup><a class="footnote footnote_ref">3</a></sup> used to judge success in this task.
- Applies one or more approaches that generate solutions to the problem in an attempt to maximize or minimize the specified fitness functions.

## Specific Attributes
We stress that the use of optimization in SE is still a rapidly evolving field. Hence, the following criteria are approximate and there may exist many exceptions to them. Reviewers should reward sound and novel work and, where possible, support a diverse range of studies.
### Essential
<checklist name="Essential">  

<intro>

- [ ] explains why the problem cannot be optimized manually or by brute force within a reasonable timeframe<sup><a class="footnote footnote_ref">4</a></sup> 
- [ ] EITHER: describes prior state of the art in this area  
      OR: carefully motivates and defines the problem tackled and the solution proposed 

<method>

- [ ] describes the search space (e.g., constraints, independent variables choices)
- [ ] uses realistic and limited simplifications and constraints for the optimization problem; simplifications and constraints do not reduce the search to one where all solutions could be enumerated through brute force
- [ ] justifies the choice of algorithm<sup><a class="footnote footnote_ref">5</a></sup> underlying the approach<sup><a class="footnote footnote_ref">6</a></sup>
- [ ] compares approaches to a justified and appropriate baseline<sup><a class="footnote footnote_ref">7</a></sup>
- [ ] explictly defines the solution formulation, including a description of what a solution represents<sup><a class="footnote footnote_ref">8</a></sup>, how it is represented<sup><a class="footnote footnote_ref">9</a></sup>, and how it is manipulated
- [ ] explicitly defines all fitness functions, including the type of goals that are optimized and the equations for calculating fitness values
- [ ] explicitly defines evaluated approaches, including the techniques, specific heuristics, and the parameters and their values<sup><a class="footnote footnote_ref">10</a></sup>
- [ ] EITHER: clearly describes (and follows) a sound process to collect and prepare the datasets used to run and to evaluate the optimization approach  
      OR: if the subjects are taken from previous work, fully reference the original source and explain whether any transformation or cleaning was applied to the datasets
- [ ] EITHER: makes data publicly available 
      OR: explains why this is not possible<sup><a class="footnote footnote_ref">11</a></sup>      
- [ ] identifies and explains all possible sources of stochasticity<sup><a class="footnote footnote_ref">12</a></sup>
- [ ] EITHER: executes stochastic approaches or elements multiple times  
      OR: explains why this is not possible<sup><a class="footnote footnote_ref">13</a></sup>

### Desirable
<checklist name="Desirable">

- [ ] provides a replication package that conforms to SIGSOFT standards for artifacts<sup><a class="footnote footnote_ref">14</a></sup>. 
- [ ] motivates the novelty and soundness of the proposed approach<sup><a class="footnote footnote_ref">15</a></sup>
- [ ] explains whether the study explores a new problem type (or a new area within an existing problem space), or how it reproduces, replicates, or improves upon prior work 
- [ ] explains in detail how subjects or datasets were collected/chosen to mitigate selection bias and improve the generalization of findings 
- [ ] describes the main features of the subjects used to run and evaluate the optimization approach(es) and discuss what characterizes the different instances in terms of "hardness" 
- [ ] justifies the use of synthetic data (if any); explain why real-world data cannot be used; discusses the extent to which the proposed approach and the findings can apply to the real world
- [ ] (if data cannot be shared) provides a sample dataset that can be shared to illustrate the approach 
- [ ] selects a realistic option space for formulating a solution; any values set for attributes should reflect one that might be chosen in a "real-world" solution, and not generated from an arbitrary distribution
- [ ] justifies the parameter values used when executing the evaluated approaches (and note that experiments trying a wide range of different parameter values would be extraordinary, see below) 
- [ ] samples from data multiple times in a controlled manner (where appropriate and possible)
- [ ] performs multiple trials either as a cross-validation (multiple independent executions) or temporally (multiple applications as part of a timed sequence), depending on the problem at hand 
- [ ] provides random data splits (e.g., those used in data-driven approaches) or ensures splits are reproducibile. 
- [ ] compares distributions (rather than means) of results using appropriate statistics
- [ ] compares solutions using an appropriate meta-evaluation criteria<sup><a class="footnote footnote_ref">16</a></sup>; justifies the chosen criteria
- [ ] clearly distinguishes evidence-based results from interpretations and speculation<sup><a class="footnote footnote_ref">17</a></sup>
</checklist>

### Extraordinary
<checklist name="Extraordinary">

- [ ] analyzes different parameter choices to the algorithm, indicating how the final parameters were selected<sup><a class="footnote footnote_ref">18</a></sup> 
- [ ] analyzes the fitness landscape for one or more of the chosen fitness functions  
</checklist>

## General Quality Criteria

The most valuable quality criteria for optimization studies in SE include reliability, replicability, reproducibility, rigor, and usefulness (see [Glossary](../glossary)). 

## Examples of Acceptable Deviations

 - The number of trials can be constrained by available time or experimental resources (e.g. where experiments are time-consuming to repeat or have human elements). In such cases, multiple trials are still ideal, but a limited number of trials can be justified as long as the limitations are disclosed and the possible effects of stochasticity are discussed.
 - The use of industrial case studies is important in demonstrating the real-world application of a proposed technique, but industrial data generally cannot be shared. In such cases, it is recommended that a small open-source example be prepared and distributed as part of a replication package to demonstrate how the approach can be applied.

## Antipatterns

- Reporting significance tests (e.g., Mann-Whitney Wilcoxon test) without effect size tests (see **Notes**)
- Conducting multiple trials but failing to disclose or discuss the variation between trials; for instance reporting a measure of central (e.g. median) without any indication of variance (e.g., a boxplot).

## Invalid Criticisms

- The paper is unimportant. Be cautious of rejecting papers that seem “unimportant” (in the eyes of a reviewer). Research is exploratory and it is about taking risks. Clealy-motivated research and speculative exploration are both important and should be rewarded.
- The paper just uses older algorithms with no reference to recent work. Using  older (and widely understood algorithms) may be valid when they are used, e.g., (1) as part of a larger set that compares many approaches; e.g. (2) to offer a “straw man” method that defines the “floor” of the performance (that everything else needs to beat); or (3), as a workbench within which one thing is changed (e.g., the fitness function) but everything else remains constant.
- That an approach is not benchmarked against an inappropriate or unavailable baseline. If a state-of-the-art approach lacks an available and functional implementation, it is not reasonable to expect the author to recreate that approach for benchmarking purposes. 
- That a multi-objective approach is not compared to a single-objective approach by evaluating each objective separately. This is not a meaningful comparison because, in a multi-objective problem, the trade-off between the objectives is a major factor in result quality. It is more important to consider the Pareto frontiers and quality indicators.
- That one or very few subjects are used, as long as the paper offers a reasonable justification for why this was the case.

## Notes

Regarding the difference between "significance" and "effect size" tests: "Significance" checks if distributions can be distinguished from each other while "Effect size" tests are required to check if the difference between distributions is "interesting" (and not just a trivially "small effect"). These tests can be parametric or non-parametric. For example, code for the parametric t-test/Hedges significance/effect tests endorsed by Kampenese et al. can be found at https://tinyurl.com/y4o7ucnx.  Code for a parametric Scott-Knot/Cohen test of the kind endorsed by Mittas et al. is available at https://tinyurl.com/y5tg37fp. Code for the non-parametric bootstrap/Cliffs Delta significant/effect tests of the  kind endorsed by  Efron et al. and Arcuri et al.
