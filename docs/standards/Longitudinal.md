# Longitudinal Studies

<standard name="Longitudinal">


*<desc>A study focusing on the changes in and evolution of a phenomenon over time</desc>*



## Application

This standard applies to studies that involve repeated observations of the same variables (e.g., productivity or technical debt) over a period of time. Longitudinal studies include the analysis of datasets over time, such as the analysis of the evolution of the code. Longitudinal studies require to maintain identifiability of subjects (humans or artifacts) between data collection waves and to use at least two waves.

For cross-sectional analysis, consider the **Exploratory Data Science Standard** or the **Experiments Standard** (if variables are manipulated).

</checklist>
    
### Extraordinary Attributes
<checklist name="Extraordinary">

- [ ] uses a multi-stage selection process to identify the study's subjects<sup><a class="footnote footnote_ref">9</a></sup>
</checklist>
- [ ] follows subjects for an exceptionally long period (e.g. more than five years)    

## General Quality Criteria

Reliability, internal validity, conclusion validity, construct validity, and external validity.

Longitudinal studies exploit the temporal nature of data to maximize internal validity. Other criteria are sometimes sacrificed to improve internal validity.   

## Antipatterns

- subject loss between waves is too high, leading to a severely underpowered study
- the period between waves does not match the phenomenon's natural cycles
- treating longitudinal data as cross-sectional

## Variations

- _Experience sampling_ provides a highly specific understanding of a phenomenon through multiple repeated measurements per day over a short period (typically one to three weeks). It emphasizes in-the-moment assessment rather than reflective assessment (van Berkel et al. 2017). This standard applies to experience sampling studies.
- _Cohort studies_ are a type of analytical observational study where researchers investigate the relationship between an independent and dependent variable by observing subjects over time and comparing groups with different levels of exposure. Cohort studies follow more strict rules than presented here.<sup><a class="footnote footnote_ref">10</a></sup>

## Invalid Criticisms

- Claiming that the time span between measurements is too short or too long.
- Claiming that the number of waves is inadequate without a reasoned explanation.
- Claiming that the sample size is too small without performing a _post hoc_ power calculation.
- Claiming that the paper with a modest number of comparisons should have used more conservative alphas or adopted a Bayesian approach.
- Complaining about generalizability when the paper clearly acknowledges limitations to generalizability.

<footnote><sup><a class="footnote footnote_text">2</a></sup>Although there might not be one best method for a specific problem, it should still be discussed on a subjective level (e.g., why it fits best to the research question) and at an objective level (e.g., data normality).</footnote><br>
<footnote><sup><a class="footnote footnote_text">3</a></sup>Several different statistical approaches are used to analyze longitudinal data (Kehr &amp; Kowatsch provide a partial overview).</footnote><br>
<footnote><sup><a class="footnote footnote_text">4</a></sup>The choice of thresholds (e.g., _p_-values \&lt; 0.05) should be discussed, to avoid Type I errors. Typically, longitudinal analyses deal with many variables and multiple comparisons, increasing the likelihood to obtain results within traditionally acceptable thresholds. For this reason, authors are advised to adjust the critical alpha level (e.g., using as a threshold _p_-values \&lt; 0.001) or use Bayesian statistics (Simmons et al., 2011).</footnote><br>
<footnote><sup><a class="footnote footnote_text">5</a></sup>Determining the sample size is of utter importance to avoid Type II errors. Thus, authors might define their sample size using a priori power calculations. At the same time, reviewers can control adequate size through a post hoc analysis (Faul, 2019).</footnote><br>
<footnote><sup><a class="footnote footnote_text">6</a></sup>The research design should explicitly state how the sample has been selected and filtered out through a selection process. For example, how are we sure to have included only software engineers when dealing with human subjects? Or, which type of quality controls have been performed on software repositories to ensure the consistency and homogeneity of artifacts?</footnote><br>
<footnote><sup><a class="footnote footnote_text">7</a></sup>It should be clear, which are the factors being investigated and how they have been selected. Similarly, measurements should show adequate reliability based on literature benchmarks (e.g., Cronbach&#39;s alpha, test-retest reliability between waves).</footnote><br>
<footnote><sup><a class="footnote footnote_text">8</a></sup>For example, if you analyze the past 100 years of stock market performance based on the markets that exist today, you get much higher average returns than if you analyze all the markets that existed 100 years ago. </footnote><br>
<footnote><sup><a class="footnote footnote_text">9</a></sup>An example of such a selection process can be found in Russo, Daniel, and Klaas-Jan Stol. &quot;Gender differences in personality traits of software engineers.&quot; _IEEE Transactions on Software Engineering_ (2020).</footnote><br>
