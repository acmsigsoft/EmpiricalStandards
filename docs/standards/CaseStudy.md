# Case Study and Ethnography 
<standard name="Case Study and Ethnography">


*<desc>"An empirical inquiry that investigates a contemporary phenomenon (the
"case") in depth and within its real-world context, especially when the
boundaries between phenomenon and context are unclear" (Yin 2017)</desc>*


## Application 

This standard applies to empirical research that meets the following
conditions.

-   Presents a detailed account of a specific instance of a *phenomenon*
    at a *site*. The phenomenon can be virtually anything of interest
    (e.g. Unix, cohesion metrics, communication issues). The site can be
    a community, an organization, a team, a person, a process, an
    internet platform, etc.
-   Features direct or indirect observation (e.g. interviews, focus
    groups)---see Lethbridge et al.'s (2005) taxonomy.
-   Is not an experience report (cf. Perry et al. 2004) or a series of
    shallow inquiries at many different sites.

A case study can be brief (e.g. a week of observation) or longitudinal
(if observation exceeds the natural rhythm of the site; e.g., observing
a product over many releases). For our purposes, *case study subsumes
ethnography*.

If data collection and analysis are interleaved, consider the **Grounded
Theory** Standard. If the study mentions action research, or intervenes
in the context, consider the **Action Research** Standard. If the study
captures a large quantitative dataset with limited context, consider the
**Data Science** Standard.

</checklist>
    
## General Quality Criteria 

Case studies should be evaluated using qualitative validity criteria
such as credibility, multivocality, reflexivity, rigor, and
transferability (see [Glossary](../glossary)). Quantitative quality criteria such
as replicability, generalizability and objectivity typically do not
apply.

## Types of Case Studies 

There is no standard way of conducting a case study. Case study research
can adopt different philosophies, most notably (post-)positivism (Lee
1989) and interpretivism/constructivism (Walsham 1995), and serve
different purposes, including:

-   a **descriptive case study** describes---in vivid detail--a
    particular instance of a phenomenon
-   an **emancipatory case study** identifies social, cultural, or
    political domination "that may hinder human ability" (Runeson and
    Host 2009), commensurate with a critical epistemological stance
-   an **evaluative case study** evaluates a priori research questions,
    propositions, hypotheses or technological artifacts
-   an **explanatory case study** explains how or why a phenomenon
    occurred, typically using a process or variance theory
-   an **exploratory case study** explores a particular phenomenon to
    identify new questions, propositions or hypotheses
-   an **historical case study** draws on archival data, for instance,
    software repositories
-   a **revelatory case study** examines a hitherto unknown or
    unexplored phenomenon

## Antipatterns 

-   Relying on a single approach to data collection (e.g. interviews)
    without corroboration or data triangulation
-   Oversimplifying and over-rationalizing complex phenomena; presenting
    messy, complicated things as simple and clean

## Invalid Criticisms 

-   Does not present quantitative data.
-   Sample of one; findings not generalizable. The point of a case study
    is to study one thing deeply, not to generalize to a population.
    Case studies should lead to theoretical generalization; that is,
    concepts that are transferable in principle.
-   Lack of internal validity. Internal validity only applies to
    explanatory case studies that seek to establish causality.
-   Lack of reproducibility or a "replication package"; Data are not
    disclosed (qualitative data are often confidential).
-   Insufficient number or length of interviews. There is no magic
    number; what matters is that there is enough data that the findings
    are credible, and the description is deep and rich.
