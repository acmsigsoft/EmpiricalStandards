# Replication
<standard name="Replication">


*<desc>A study that deliberately repeats a previous study (the "original study") to determine whether its results can be reproduced</desc>* (Carver et al., 2013)


## Application 

This standard applies to empirical studies that meet the following criteria:

- The replication attempt is deliberate and planned, not accidental overlap with a previous study.
- The original study is clearly identified as a separate previous publication. If the replication is not the only replication of the original study, i.e., it is a part of a *family of replications*, all the other replications are identified and the current replication is clearly defined in the context of the family.
 

## Definitions
  
To _[reproduce](../glossary#reproducibility)_ means to repeat the original study's data analysis on the original study's data.
  
To _[replicate](../glossary#replicability)_ means to repeat a study by collecting new data and repeating the original study's analysis on the new data.


## Specific Attributes
	
### Essential Attributes
	
<checklist name="Essential">

<intro>

- [ ] discusses the motivation for conducting the replication in appropriate detail (e.g., to validate the results, to broaden the results by changing the participant pool or the artifacts)
- [ ] defines the type of the replication by methodological similarity (exact, methodological, conceptual)<sup><a class="footnote footnote_ref">1</a></sup>
- [ ] defines the type of the replication by overlap (partial, complete, extended)<sup><a class="footnote footnote_ref">2</a></sup>
- [ ] defines the type of the replication by participants (internal, external, mixed)<sup><a class="footnote footnote_ref">3</a></sup>

<method>

- describes the original study in appropriate detail, including:
  - [ ] the research questions of the original study
  - [ ] the design of the original study 
  - [ ] if applicable, the participants of the original study (their number and any relevant characteristics)
  - [ ] the artifacts of the original study<sup><a class="footnote footnote_ref">4</a></sup>
  - [ ] the context variables of the original study that might have affected the design of the study or interpretation of the results
  - [ ] the major findings of the original study
- [ ] 	EITHER: describes overlap or interactions with the original study author(s),
	OR: confirms that the original study author(s) were not involved in the replication 
- [ ] describes and justifies any differences from the original study (design, participants, artifacts, procedures, data collection, or analysis)

<results>

- [ ] compares the results of the replication to the results of the original study
- [ ] clearly differentiates between results that are consistent and inconsistent with the original study

</checklist>
     
### Desirable Attributes

<checklist name="Desirable">

- [ ] 	clearly seperates information about (i) the original study, (ii) the replication, (iii) the comparison of results, and (iv) conclusions <sup><a class="footnote footnote_ref">5</a></sup>
- [ ] 	improves on the original study in some way (e.g., design, analysis, statistical power)
- for *families of replications*:
  	- [ ] provides a brief summary of the previous studies and replications, including information about how the studies were related, conclusions drawn and current state of knowledge about the topic 
	- [ ] places the results into the context of the entire family of studies 
  	- [ ] draws conclusions based on analysis of the results of the entire family of studies 	
- [ ] 	differentiates between minor and major differences when discussing inconsistent results, elaborates on whether the differences are reasonable and/or expected
- [ ]	draws conclusions across the two (or more) studies; provides insights that would not have been evident from either study individually
- [ ] 	highlights any conclusions of the original study that were strengthened
- [ ] 	compares the limitations of the replication to the limitations of the original study
- [ ] 	proposes hypotheses about new context variables that may have become evident through the analysis of multiple studies
- [ ] 	protocol of the replication was checked/reviewed by the original authors 

</checklist> 


<!-- ### Extraordinary Attributes

## Antipatterns
	
- replicating an underpowered study with a second, equally-underpowered study
- repeating rather than correcting mistakes (e.g. using inappropriate statistical tests) in the original study 


## Invalid Criticisms

- The replication merely confirms the findings of the original study; no inconsistencies are reported.
- Failing to publish (e.g., in a replication package) materials owned by the original study authors who have not given permission to publish them. 
- Criticizing the research questions including their wording or formulation (since the research questions are set in the original study, the replication must follow them, even in conceptual replications).
