# Grounded Theory

<standard name="Grounded Theory">

*<desc>A study of a specific area of interest or phenomenon that involves
iterative and interleaved rounds of qualitative data collection and
analysis, leading to key patterns (e.g. concepts, categories)</desc>*


## Application 

This standard applies to empirical inquiries that meet all of the
following conditions:

-   Explores a broad area of investigation without specific, up-front
    research questions.
-   Applies theoretical sampling with iterative and interleaved rounds
    of data collection and analysis.
-   Reports rich and nuanced findings, typically including verbatim
    quotes and samples of raw data.

For predominately qualitative inquiries that do not iterate between data
collection and analysis or do not use theoretical sampling, consider the
**Case Study Standard** or the **Qualitative Survey Standard**.

## Specific Attributes 

### Essential Attributes 
<checklist name="Essential">

<intro>


<method>

- [ ]	identifies the version of Grounded Theory used/adapted (Glaser, Strauss-Corbin, Charmaz, etc.)
- [ ]	explains how data source(s) were selected and accessed (e.g. participant sampling strategy)
- [ ]	describes data sources (e.g. participants' demographics, work roles)
- [ ]	explains how the research iterated between data collection and analysis using constant comparison and theoretical sampling
- [ ]	provides evidence of saturation; explains how saturation was achieved<sup><a class="footnote footnote_ref">1</a></sup> 
- [ ]	explains how key patterns (e.g. categories) emerged from GT steps (e.g. selective coding)
    
<results>

- [ ]	provides clear chain of evidence from raw data (e.g. interviewee quotations) to derived codes, concepts, and categories

<discussion>

<other>
     
</checklist>    
    
### Desirable Attributes 
<checklist name="Desirable">
    
- [ ]	provides supplemental materials such as interview guide(s), coding schemes, coding examples, decision rules, or extended chain-of-evidence tables
- [ ]	explains how and why study adapts or deviates from claimed GT version
- [ ]	presents a mature, fully-developed theory or taxonomy
- [ ]	includes diverse participants and/or data sources (e.g. software repositories, forums)
- [ ]	uses direct quotations extensively to support key points
- [ ]	explains how memo writing was used to drive the work
- [ ]   validates results using member checking, dialogical interviewing, feedback from non-participant practitioners or research audits of coding by advisors or other researchers
- [ ]	discusses transferability; characterizes the setting such that readers can assess transferability
- [ ]	compares results with (or integrates them into) prior theory or related research
- [ ]	explains theoretical sampling vis-à-vis the interplay between the sampling process, the emerging findings, and theoretical gaps perceived therein
- [ ]	reflects on how researcher’s biases may have affected their analysis
- [ ]	explains the role of literature, especially where an extensive review preceded the GT study
</checklist>
     
### Extraordinary Attributes 
<checklist name="Extraordinary">

- [ ]	triangulates with extensive quantitative data (e.g. questionnaires, sentiment analysis)
- [ ]	employs a team of researchers and explains their roles 
</checklist>

## Quality Criteria 

Glaser, Strauss, Corbin and Charmaz advance inconsistent quality
criteria. Using definitions in our [Glossary](../glossary), reviewers should
consider common qualitative criteria such as **credibility**,
**resonance**, **usefulness** and the degree to which results *extend*
our cumulative knowledge. Quantitative quality criteria such as internal
validity, construct validity, replicability, generalizability and
reliability typically do not apply.

## Examples of Acceptable Deviations 

-   In a study of sexual harassment at a named organization, detailed
    description of interviewees and direct quotations are omitted to
    protect participants.

## Antipatterns

-   Conducting data collection and data analysis sequentially; applying
    only analysis techniques of GT.
-   Data analysis focusing on counting words, codes, concepts, or
    categories instead of interpreting.
-   Presenting a tutorial on grounded theory instead of explaining how
    the current study was conducted.
-   Small, heterogenous samples creating the illusion of convergence and
    theoretical saturation. For example, it is highly unlikely that a
    full theory can be derived only from interviews with 20 people.
-   Focusing only on interviews without corroborating statements with
    other evidence (e.g. documents, observation).

## Invalid Criticisms

-   Lack of quantitative data; causal analysis; objectivity, internal
    validity, reliability, or generalizability.
-   Lack of replicability or reproducibility; not releasing transcripts
-   Lack of representativeness (e.g. of a study of Turkish programmers,
    'how does this generalize to America?')
-   Research questions should have been different
-   Findings should have been presented as a different set of
    relationships, hypotheses, or a different theory.
