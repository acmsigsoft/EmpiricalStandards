# Critical Review 
<standard name="Critical Review">

*<desc>A study that appraises a sample of primary or secondary literature to critique a meta-scientific issue (e.g. a methodological problem common in an area of research)</desc>*


## Application 

-   Applies to studies that systematically collect and analyze a sample of existing articles or studies
-   Applies both to secondary and tertiary studies
-   Does not apply to ad-hoc literature reviews, case surveys, meta-analysis, qualitative synthesis, or scoping reviews
-   The distinguishing feature of a ccritical review is that its primary purpose is to _critique_, rather than synthesize, existing work

## Specific Attributes 

### Essential Attributes 
<checklist name="Essential">

<intro>

- [ ]	identifies type of review (i.e. "critical")

<method>

- [ ]	presents step-by-step, systematic, replicable description of search process<sup><a class="footnote footnote-ref">1</a></sup>  
- [ ]	defines clear selection criteria
- [ ]	specifies the data extracted from each primary study<sup><a class="footnote footnote-ref">2</a></sup>  ; explains relationships to research questions
- [ ]	describes in detail how data were extracted and synthesized (can be qualitative or quantitative)
- [ ]	describes coding scheme(s) and their use

<results>

- [ ]	clear chain of evidence from the extracted data to the answers to the research question(s)
- [ ]	presents substantive (usually but not always methodological) critique of existing work

<discussion>

- [ ] provides recommendations for researchers for overcoming the substantive critiques of existing work 

<other>		

</checklist>

### Desirable Attributes 
<checklist name="Desirable">
	
- [ ]	provides supplementary materials such as protocol, search terms, search results, selection process results; complete dataset, analysis scripts; coding scheme, examples of coding, decision rules, descriptions of edge cases
- [ ]	(positivist reviews), uses 2+ independent analysts; analyzes inter-rater reliability (see the [IRR/IRA Supplement](https://github.com/acmsigsoft/EmpiricalStandards/blob/master/docs/supplements/InterRaterReliabilityAndAgreement.md)); explains how discrepancies among coders were resolved<sup><a class="footnote footnote-ref">3</a></sup> 
- [ ]	(interpretivist reviews) reflects on how researcher’s biases may have affected their analysis
- [ ]	consolidates results using tables, diagrams, or charts 
- [ ] 	includes a PRISMA flow diagram (cf. Moher et al. 2009)
- [ ]	clearly distinguishes evidence-based results from interpretations and speculation<sup><a class="footnote footnote-ref">4</a></sup>	
</checklist>
     
### Extraordinary Attributes
<checklist name="Extraordinary">
- [ ]	includes quantitative meta-analysis or qualitative meta-synthesis in addition to critical review	
	
</checklist>

## Examples of Acceptable Deviations 

- Authors of critical reviews may not cite individual papers that exemplify identified problems, so as to avoid disparaging specific researchers

## Antipatterns 

-   Using the review to disparage individual researchers or research groups instead of highlighting ubiquitous problems 
    
## Invalid Criticisms

-   The search queries are not identical in all databases
-   The analysis strategy should be more qualitative/quantitative
-   The sample does not include every relevant paper (this would be impossible for many critical reviews)
-   No synthesis of findings is presented (synthesis is not the purpose of a critical review)
-   No meta-analysis is presented (meta-analysis is not the purpose of a critical review
-   Failed to exclude low quality studies
