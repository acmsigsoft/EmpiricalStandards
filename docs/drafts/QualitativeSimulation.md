# Qualitative Simulation - DRAFT
<standard name="Qualitative Simulation">

*<desc>A study that involves predominately qualitative analysis of direct observations of humans taking part in a lab-based simulation</desc>*


## Application 

This standard applies to empirical research that meets the following
conditions.

-   Human participants take part in a simulated task, typically in a contrived or lab-based environment, alone or in groups
-   Researchers directly observe (and often record) participants taking part
-   Observations are analyzed using qualitative coding

Protocol Analysis (AKA protocol studies) are a common type of Qualitative Simulation.

## Specific Attributes 

### Essential Attributes
<checklist name="Essential">

<intro>


<method>

- [ ]   describes the environment in which the simulation took place
- [ ]   describes the events, activities, tasks, or objects comprising the simulations    
- [ ]   describes the qualitative coding procedures

<results>

- [ ]   presents a clear chain of evidence from observations to findings

<discussion>


<other>    
    
</checklist>
    
### Desirable Attributes
<checklist name="Desirable">
    
- [ ]	  provides supplemental materials such as task materials, coding schemes, coding examples, decision rules, or extended chain-of-evidence tables
- [ ]   includes debriefing sessions with participants 
- [ ]   cross-checks observations against statements made my participants during debriefing sessions
- [ ]   describes how prior understandings of the phenomena were managed and/or influenced the research
- [ ]   EITHER: evaluates an a priori theory (or model, framework, taxonomy, etc.) using deductive coding with an a priori coding scheme based on the prior theory    
     OR: synthesizes results into a new, mature, fully-developed and clearly articulated theory (or model, etc.) using some form of inductive coding (coding scheme generated from data)
- [ ]   includes autoreflection; i.e., researchers reflect on how their own possible biases may have influenced the research
</checklist>
    
### Extraordinary Attributes
<checklist name="Extraordinary">

- [ ]   uses a team-based approach; e.g., multiple raters with analysis of inter-rater reliability (see the [IRR/IRA Supplement](https://github.com/acmsigsoft/EmpiricalStandards/blob/master/Supplements/InterRaterReliabilityAndAgreement.md))
- [ ]   published a protocol beforehand and made it publicly accessible (see the [Registered Reports Supplement](https://github.com/acmsigsoft/EmpiricalStandards/tree/master/Supplements)) 
</checklist>
    
## General Quality Criteria 

Qualitative simulations should be evaluated using qualitative validity criteria
such as credibility, multivocality, reflexivity, rigor and transferability (see **Glossary**).  

## Antipatterns 

-  Overstating the degree to which the simulation justifies inferences about participants' cognitive states or cognitive processes. The whole point of a qualitative simulation is often to get insight into cognitive states and processes, but these insights should be presented with caution.
-  Attempting a qualitative simulation from a positivist epistemological stance. There is no coherent positivist basis for qualitative research in an artificial context. Qualitative simulations make more sense from a realist or interpretivist epistemological stance.  
                                                                                                                 
## Invalid Criticisms 

-   Does not present quantitative data. That's why it's called a "qualitative" simulation.
-   The task or environment are artificial. The whole point of a qualitative simulation is to study an artificial task in a controlled environment. 
-   Lack of internal validity. Internal validity is a positivist criterion.
