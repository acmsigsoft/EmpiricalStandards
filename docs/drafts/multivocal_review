## Specific Attributes 

### Essential Attributes 
<checklist name="Essential">

<intro>

- [ ]	identifies type of review (i.e. a multivocal review)
- [ ] justifies that a multivocal review is appropriate for phenonomenon of interest

<method>

- [ ]	presents step-by-step, systematic, replicable description of search process including search terms<sup><a class="footnote footnote_ref">1</a></sup>  
- [ ]	defines clear selection criteria
- [ ]	specifies the data extracted from each primary study<sup><a class="footnote footnote_ref">2</a></sup> ; explains relationships to research questions
- [ ]	describes in detail how data were extracted and synthesized (can be qualitative or quantitative)
- [ ]	describes coding scheme(s) and their use

<results>

- [ ]	clear chain of evidence from the extracted data to the answers to the research question(s)

<discussion>

- [ ]	presents conclusions or recommendations for practitioners/non-specialists

<other>		

</checklist>

### Desirable Attributes 
<checklist name="Desirable">
	
- [ ]	provides supplementary materials such as protocol, search terms, search results, selection process results; complete dataset, analysis scripts; coding scheme, examples of coding, decision rules, descriptions of edge cases
- [ ]	mitigates sampling bias and publication bias, using some (not all) of:  
(i) manual and keyword automated searches;   
(ii) backward and forward snowballing searches;  
(iii) checking profiles of prolific authors in the area;   
(iv) searching both formal databases (e.g. ACM Digital Library) and indexes (e.g. Google Scholar);   
(v) searching for relevant dissertations;   
(vi) searching pre-print servers (e.g. arXiv);   
(iiv) soliciting unpublished manuscripts through appropriate listservs or social media;  
(iiiv) contacting known authors in the area. 
- [ ]	demonstrates that the search process is sufficiently rigorous for the systematic review goals<sup><a class="footnote footnote_ref">3</a></sup>  
- [ ]	assesses quality of primary studies using an a priori coding scheme (e.g. relevant empirical standards); explains how quality was assessed; excludes low quality studies (ok) or models study quality as a moderating variable (better) 
- [ ]	assesses coverage (e.g. funnel plots, tweedle trim-and-fill method, percentage of known papers found)
- [ ]	(positivist reviews), uses 2+ independent analysts; analyzes inter-rater reliability (see the [IRR/IRA Supplement](https://github.com/acmsigsoft/EmpiricalStandards/blob/master/docs/supplements/InterRaterReliabilityAndAgreement.md)); explains how discrepancies among coders were resolved<sup><a class="footnote footnote_ref">4</a></sup> 
- [ ]	(interpretivist reviews) reflects on how researcher’s biases may have affected their analysis
- [ ]	consolidates results using tables, diagrams, or charts 
- [ ]   includes a PRISMA flow diagram (cf. Moher et al. 2009)
- [ ]	performs analysis through an existing or new conceptual framework (qualitative synthesis)
- [ ]	uses meta-analysis methods appropriate for primary studies; does not use vote counting 
- [ ]	integrates results into prior theory or research; identifies gaps, biases, or future directions
- [ ]	presents results as practical, evidence-based guidelines for practitioners, researchers, or educators
- [ ]	clearly distinguishes evidence-based results from interpretations and speculation<sup><a class="footnote footnote_ref">5</a></sup>	
</checklist>
     
### Extraordinary Attributes
<checklist name="Extraordinary">

- [ ]	two or more researchers independently undertaking the preliminary search process before finalizing the search scope and search keywords
- [ ]	contacted primary study authors to ensure interpretations are correct, and elicit additional details not found in the papers such as access to raw data
- [ ]	applies integrative data analysis<sup><a class="footnote footnote_ref">6</a></sup>	
	
</checklist>

## Examples of Acceptable Deviations 

-   

## Antipatterns 

-   Using only grey studies when some academic literature is available
	
## Invalid Criticisms

-   The search queries are not identical in all databases.
-   The analysis strategy should be more qualitative/quantitative

<footnote><sup><a class="footnote footnote_text">5</a></sup>Simply separating results and discussion into different sections is typically sufficient. No speculation in the results section.</footnote><br>
