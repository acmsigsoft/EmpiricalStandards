# Registered Reports

_An empirical study that is published in two phases: the plan (RR1) and the results of executing the plan (RR2)_

## Definition

&quot;Registered reports&quot; refers to studies that are conducted in two phases:

- researchers create and publish a study plan, or phase 1 registered report (RR1), which is accepted _in principle_ by a publishing venue;
- researchers execute the plan and write up the results, or a phase 2 registered report (RR2), which then receives _final acceptance_ from the same publishing venue.

_Pre-registration_ refers to depositing the RR1 somewhere publicly visible. Pre-registration aims to prevent hypothesising after results are known, to mitigate unconscious researcher bias in data analysis, and combat publication bias.

## Application

This standard applies to positivist, confirmatory (i.e. hypothesis-testing) studies with tightly-scoped analysis approaches. Pre-registering interpretivist, qualitative or exploratory research remains controversial.

## Specific Attributes (RR1)

### Essential Attributes
- [ ] meets all essential criteria in _The General Standard_ except those that require data:
    - does not present results
    - does not validate assumptions of statistical tests
    - does not discuss implications
    - does not contribute to collective body of knowledge
    - does not support conclusions with evidence or arguments
- [ ] meets all essential criteria, in applicable empirical standards, that can be met before data collection<sup><a class="footnote footnote_ref">1</a></sup>
- [ ] justifies importance of the purpose, problem, objective, or research question(s)
- [ ] describes the research method in detail sufficient for an independent researcher to exactly replicate the proposed data collection and analysis procedures
- [ ] the stated hypotheses can be tested with the data the researchers propose to collect
  
### Desirable Attributes
- [ ] presents preliminary data (e.g. from a pilot study) to justify the chosen approach (e.g. probability distributions).
- [ ] includes a conditional structure (e.g. pre-specifying different tests for normal and non-normal distributions)
- [ ] explains how the study will change based on the results of data analysis (i.e. conditional analysis)<sup><a class="footnote footnote_ref">2</a></sup>

## Specific Attributes (RR2)<sup><a class="footnote footnote_ref">3</a></sup>
### Essential Attributes
- [ ] meets all essential criteria in _The General Standard_ (no exceptions)
- [ ] introduction, rationale and stated hypotheses are the same as the approved RR1 submission except for improvements based on feedback from RR1 reviews
- [ ] EITHER: adheres precisely to the registered procedures  
  OR: thoroughly justifies all deviations and explains how they affect the final analysis.  
- [ ] deviations, if any, are _not_ justified based on the data
- [ ] clearly designates as exploratory any unregistered post hoc analyses
- [ ] unregistered post hoc analysis, if any, are justified, methodologically sound, and informative
  
### Desirable Attributes
- [ ] provides evidence that data was collected after RR1 plan is accepted
 
### Extraordinary Attributes
- [ ] generates novel insights into the concept, process benefits, or limitations of registered reports

## Antipatterns

- deviating from the RR1 plan because it constrains exploratory research, when the plan did not mention exploration
- postdictive deviations from RR1 plan; i.e., changes made knowing how they would affect the outcome of the study
- Pre-registrations that are not verifiably committed prior to data collection, e.g. not time-stamped.

## Invalid Criticisms

- RR1: Insisting on complete data collection or detailed analysis and results
- RR1: Rejecting exploratory or qualitative research: all kinds of research can be pre-registered even it&#39;s not covered here
- RR2: in hindsight, the RR1 plan was not appropriate (RR2 reviews should not criticize any aspect of the RR1 plan)
- RR2: results are not statistically significant, novel, relevant or compelling; effect sizes too small

## Justifying Deviations

Reviewers should not expect research to go exactly according to plan or authors to foresee every possible problem. Changes are acceptable as long as they are justified and not _postdictive_ (i.e. changes made knowing how they will affect results). For example, researchers might drop a mistranslated question in a multi-lingual questionnaire survey.
