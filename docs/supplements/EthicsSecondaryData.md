# Ethics (Studies with Secondary Human Data)

A study that analyzes data previously gathered from (or supplied by) humans and held by a third-party

## Application

This standard applies to studies in which data previously gathered from humans and held by an organization is used by the researchers (e.g. Exploratory Data Science). This may involve researchers gathering existing data themselves through technical means (e.g. website scraping) from a site where directly-contributed data is visible (e.g. social media sites, software repositories), or using datasets collected, curated and made available by others (e.g. published research datasets).

## Specific Attributes
### Essential Attributes
- [ ] describes all plausible, non-trivial potential risks or harms to data custodians and data subjects
- [ ] describes any steps taken to mitigate risks or harms
- [ ] justifies the taking of risks and/or the causing of harm in terms of the claimed benefits of the research.
- [ ] states the grounds on which the data used was legitimately available to the researchers<sup><a class="footnote footnote_ref">1</a></sup> 
- [ ] explains how the research falls within the permissions given by the original data subjects<sup><a class="footnote footnote_ref">2</a></sup> 
- [ ] explains the provenance of the original data in terms of the data custodian&#39;s documentation of the conditions of data capture, and whether this capture met the standards required for Studies with Human Participants (particularly in respect of consent for capture and future use).
- [ ] explains how participants&#39; privacy and reputation was respected in the conduct and reporting of the research. In particular, where multiple datasets are combined, explains how any additional privacy risks raised by this were mitigated.
- [ ] explains how the privacy and consent of data subjects was respected during the research with reference to the conditions under which data was made available to the researcher<sup><a class="footnote footnote_ref">3</a></sup> , and how any further publication of the data (in existing, combined, or transformed form) will respect the expectations and consent given by data subjects.

### Desirable Attributes
- [ ] explains how the researchers considered the impact of the research on those whose data was used
- [ ] cites, with application number, approval of a national, institutional, or other appropriate scholarly ethical review board
- [ ] cites the reference ethics framework(s) within which the work was conducted<sup><a class="footnote footnote_ref">4</a></sup> 

### Extraordinary Attributes
- [ ] supplementary materials include a complete application to a scholarly ethical review board and documentation of its approval

## General Quality Criteria

Research should balance the anticipated benefits of a study with the potential risks and/or harms to participants, minimizing risk or harm wherever possible. In secondary data studies, researchers typically do not have access to the original data subjects and may therefore need to justify research based on information and terms supplied and imposed by intermediaries (to whom researchers also have ethical responsibilities). Researchers&#39; ethical responsibility to the original participants remains and thus they have an ethical duty to seek and verify the provenance of the data they use, verify whether their intended use falls within the reasonable expectation and consent of those whose data it is, and to respect the rights and roles of the intermediaries as the proximate representatives of those for whose data they are responsible. Any use of data that is not legitimately available must be justified _on strong and documented ethical grounds_.

## Antipatterns

- Justifying data use as acceptable solely because it is technically available (e.g. machine accessible or downloadable) as opposed to legitimately available (i.e. under the custodian&#39;s terms of access and use, and with verified provenance permitting the current use under the terms of the original data surrender).<sup><a class="footnote footnote_ref">5</a></sup> 
- Reidentification (or creating the conditions for reidentification) of the data subjects whose data is analyzed.<sup><a class="footnote footnote_ref">6</a></sup> 
- Failing to consider potential, harmful, unintended consequences of the research.
- Accepting (e.g. from a corporation) a dataset that has been collected without adhering to the principles set forth in the **Ethics (Studies with Human Participants)**  **Standard** ; e.g. without participants&#39; consent or appropriate safeguards.

## Examples of Acceptable Deviations

- Using data outside of the norms of legitimate access _on strong and documented ethical grounds_ (preferably citing approval of a national, institutional, or other appropriate scholarly ethical review board).
- Reidentification of data subjects where there are _strong and documented ethical grounds_ for disclosure of identity (e.g. to expose subject&#39;s unethical behavior).
- Using data with unknown provenance _if and only if_ data provenance information is unavailable from the custodian _and_ the use is justified in terms of the balance between research benefit and risks to those whose data is used.

## Invalid Criticisms

- &quot;Study was not approved by an ethical review board&quot; is not grounds for rejection unless there is a substantive ethical concern that such a board should have prevented.

## Note

Rarely, ethical research may require unlawful action. Ethical frameworks like Menlo include legal compliance so that the ethicality and legality of research can be weighed together. Therefore, the presence of a legally dubious action is not grounds for rejection _if and only if_ the action is ethically justified, including _the risks to the researcher._
