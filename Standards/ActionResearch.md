# Action Research 
<standard name="Action Research">

Empirical research that investigates how an intervention, like the
introduction of a method or tool, affects a real-life context

## Application 

This standard applies to empirical research that meets the following
conditions.

-   investigates a primarily social phenomenon within its real-life,
    organizational context
-   intervenes in the real-life context (otherwise see the **Case Study
    Standard**)
-   the change and its observation are an integral part of addressing
    the research question and contribute to research

If the intervention primarily alters social phenomena (e.g. the
organization's processes, culture, way of working or group dynamics),
use this standard. If the intervention is a new technology or technique
(e.g. a testing tool, a coding standard, a modeling grammar), especially
if it lacks a social dimension, consider the **Engineering Research
Standard**. If the research involves creating a technology and an
organizational intervention with a social dimension, consider both
standards.

## Specific Attributes
### Essential Attributes
<checklist name="Essential">

-	describes the context or site of the intervention(s)
-   describes the intervention(s) in detail
-   describes the relationship between the researcher and the host organization<sup>[5](#myfootnote5)</sup>
-   reports the length of the project and describes the longitudinal dimension of the research design
-   describes the interactions between researcher(s) and host organization(s)---what the interventions were, who intervened and with which part of the organization, as well as the outcome of the interventions
-   describes how interventions were determined (by management, researchers, or participative/co- determination process)
-   explains research cycles or phases, if any, and their relationship to the intervention(s)<sup>[6](#myfootnote6)</sup>
-   explains how the interventions are evaluated<sup>[7](#myfootnote7)</sup>
-   reports participant or stakeholder reactions to interventions
-   presents a clear and well-argued chain-of-evidence from observations to findings
-   reports lessons learned by the organization
-   researchers reflect on their own possible biases
</checklist>
    
### Desirable Attributes
<checklist name="Desirable">

-	uses direct quotations extensively
-   uses member checking to assess resonance
-   findings plausibly transferable to other contexts
-   triangulation across quantitative and qualitative data
</checklist>
    
### Extraordinary Attributes
<checklist name="Extraordinary">

-	research team with triangulation across researchers (to mitigate researcher bias)
</checklist>
     
## General Quality Criteria 

Example criteria include reflexivity, credibility, resonance, usefulness
and transferability (see **Glossary**). Positivist quality criteria such
as internal validity, construct validity, generalizability and
reliability typically do not apply.

## Examples of Acceptable Deviations 

-   In a study of deviations from organizational standards, detailed
    description of circumstances and direct quotations are omitted to
    protect participants.
-   The article reports a negative outcome of an intervention and e.g.
    investigates why a certain method was not applicable.

## Antipatterns 

-   Forcing interventions that are not acceptable to participants or the
    host organization.
-   Losing professional distance and impartiality; getting too involved
    with the community under study.
-   Over-selling a tool or method without regard for participants'
    problems, practices or values.
-   Avoiding systematic evaluation; downplaying problems; simply
    reporting participants views of the intervention.

## Invalid Criticisms 

-   The findings and insights are not valid because the research
    intervened in the context. Though reflexivity is crucial, the whole
    point of action research is to introduce a change and observe how
    participants react.
-   This is merely consultancy or an experience report. Systematic
    observation and reflection should not be dismissed as consultancy or
    experience reports. Inversely, consultancy or experiences should not
    be falsely presented as action research.
-   Lack of quantitative data; causal analysis; objectivity, internal
    validity, reliability, or generalizability.
-   Sample not representative; lack of generalizability; generalizing
    from one organization.
-   Lack of replicability or reproducibility; not releasing transcripts.
-   Lack of control group or experimental protocols. An action research
    study is not an experiment.

<sup>[5](#myfootnote5)</sup> E.g. project financing, potential conflicts of interest, professional relationship leading to access  
<sup>[6](#myfootnote6)</sup> Action research projects are structured in interventions often described as action research cycles, which are often structured in distinct phases. It is a flexible methodology, where subsequent cycles are based on their predecessors.
