# Systematic Reviews 
<standard name="Systematic Reviews">
*A study that appraises, analyses, and synthesizes primary or secondary literature to provide a complete, exhaustive summary of current evidence regarding one or more specific topics or research questions*

## Application 

-   Applies to studies that systematically find and analyze existing
    literature about a specified topic
-   Applies both to secondary and tertiary studies
-   Does not apply to ad-hoc literature reviews, case surveys or
    advanced qualitative synthesis methods (e.g. meta-ethnography)

## Specific Attributes 

### Essential Attributes 
<checklist name="Essential">
	
- [ ]	presents step-by-step, systematic, replicable description of search process including search terms<sup>[1](#myfootnote1)</sup>  
- [ ]	defines clear inclusion and exclusion criteria
- [ ]	specifies the data extracted from each primary study<sup>[2](#myfootnote2)</sup>  ; explains relationships to research questions
- [ ]	describes in detail how data were extracted and synthesized (can be qualitative or quantitative)
- [ ]	describes coding scheme(s) and their use
- [ ]	clear chain of evidence from the extracted data to the answers to the research question(s)
- [ ]	presents conclusions or recommendations for practitioners/non-specialists
- [ ]	identifies method (e.g. systematic review, meta-analysis, mapping study, narrative synthesis, etc.)
</checklist>

### Desirable Attributes 
<checklist name="Desirable">
	
- [ ]	provides replication package including protocol, search terms, search results, selection process results; complete dataset, analysis scripts; examples of coding, decision rules or edge cases
- [ ]	mitigates sampling bias and publication bias, using some combination of: 
(i) manual and keyword automated searches;   
(ii) backward and forward snowballing searches;  
(iii) checking profiles of prolific authors in the area;   
(iv) searching both formal databases (e.g. ACM Digital Library) and indexes (e.g. Google Scholar);   
(v) searching for relevant dissertations;   
(vi) searching pre-print servers (e.g. arXiv);   
(iiv) soliciting unpublished manuscripts through appropriate listservs or social media;  
(iiiv) contacting known authors in the area. 
- [ ]	demonstrates that the search process is sufficiently rigorous for the systematic review goals<sup>[3](#myfootnote3)</sup>  
- [ ]	assesses quality of primary studies; explains how quality was assessed 
- [ ]	assesses coverage using funnel plots or percentage of known papers found
- [ ]	(positivist reviews), uses 2+ independent analysts; analyzes inter-rater reliability (e.g. KALPHA) 
- [ ]	(interpretivist reviews) reflects on how researcher’s biases may have affected their analysis
- [ ]	consolidates results using tables, diagrams, or charts; PRISMA flow diagram (cf. Moher et al. 2009)
- [ ]	performs analysis through an existing or new conceptual framework (qualitative synthesis)
- [ ]	uses meta-analysis methods appropriate for primary studies; does not use vote counting 
- [ ]	integrates results into prior theory or research; identifies gaps, biases, or future directions
- [ ]	presents results as practical, evidence-based guidelines for practitioners, researchers, or educators	
</checklist>
     
### Extraordinary Attributes
<checklist name="Extraordinary">

- [ ]	two or more researchers independently undertaking the preliminary search process before finalizing the search scope and search keywords
- [ ]	contacted primary study authors to ensure interpretations are correct, and elicit additional details not found in the papers such as access to raw data
</checklist>

## Examples of Acceptable Deviations 

-   No attempts to mitigate publication bias in a study explicitly
    examining a specific venue's (e.g. CACM or ICSE) coverage of a given
    topic.
-   Using probability sampling on primary studies when there are too
    many to analyze (i.e. thousands).
-   No recommendations for practitioners in a study of a methodological
    issue (e.g. representative sampling).

## Antipatterns 

-   A laundry-list description of the studies (A found X, B found Y,
    ...), rather than a synthesis of the findings.
-   Relying on characteristics of the publication venues as a proxy for
    the quality of the primary studies instead of assessing primary
    studies' quality explicitly.
-   Reviewing an area in which there are too few high-quality primary
    studies to draw reliable conclusions.
